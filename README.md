# Circadian-Luciferase-Analysis
Analyzes large-scale luminescence data taken every hour from 96-well plates over a time course and calculates circadian amplitude, period, and phase using the MetaCycle package in R (https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycle). This code further processes and organizes the data for easier use, adding group options and options for statistical tests at the users' discretion.
