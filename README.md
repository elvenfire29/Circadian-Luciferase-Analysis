# Circadian-Luciferase-Analysis
Analyzes large-scale luminescence data taken every hour from 96-well plates over a time course and calculates circadian amplitude, period, and phase using the MetaCycle package in R (https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycle). This script further processes and organizes the data for easier use, adding group options and options for statistical tests at the users' discretion. 

The script is meant to be user-friendly and open-source. While not in a package, there is a clear divide between initial instructions, user-input, and the rest of the script. All user-input has commented out descriptions of what is needed for each input option. 

# Use
Simply download and/or copy the complete script and open in R or RStudio, fill in the required and desired input changes, and run the script. The output will be created in a file named after the user's input file of the 96-well plate data.
