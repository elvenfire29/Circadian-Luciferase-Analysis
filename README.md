# Circadian-Luciferase-Analysis
Analyzes luminescence data taken every hour over a time course for circadian patterns, such as amplitude, period, and phase using the MetaCycle package in R (https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycle). This code further processes and organizes the data for easier use, adding group options and options for statistical tests at the users' discretion.
