# Script Output Files

The output depends on the selections of the user in the user input sections. The user can include a folder with t-test results, a folder with ANOVA results, and/or a file with graphs in the output folder. The output folder will appear in the location set as the working directory in the User Input I section. 

The output that is always included is an output folder named after the input file. This folder will always contain a file with the averaged period, amplitude, and phase of each treatment and a file with averaged luminescence data for each treatment over time for the user's graphing concenience. Additionally, there will be a subfolder called "Individual Wells" that holds a file with each replicate listed per treatment for the luminescence data over time. The subfolder also contains a file with individual well values for period, phase, and amplitude laid out in the same way as the 96-well plate. Additionally, there are files that are for ease of use for graphing with programs like PRISM. These files have the individual values for period, phase, or amplitude for each individual well per treatment for all treatments. 

Here is a figure of the full possible output from the script:
